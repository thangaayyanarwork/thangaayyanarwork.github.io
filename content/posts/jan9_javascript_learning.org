I learned few awesome javascript tricks this week

*** Structured clone
- Deep copy a java object, you can also transfer i.e detach object from one to another.
#+begin_src javascript
const superhero = {}
superhero.dc = ["superman", "batman"];
superhero.marvel = ["captain","ironman"];

const superheroClone = structuredClone(superhero);
superheroClone.marvel.push("spiderman");

console.log(superhero.marvel); // [ "captain", "ironman" ]
console.log(superheroClone.marvel); // [ "captain", "ironman", "spiderman" ]
#+end_src

*** Event Listener

**** Scroll end
- I was looking similar to this for a week and found this listener.
- The listener will trigger for user as well as after javascript scrollTo.
#+begin_src javascript
  ELEMENT.addEventListener("scrollend", (event) => { })
#+end_src
- ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollend_event

**** Offline and Online listener
- Listener to get trigger for offline and online functionality.
#+begin_src javascript
  window.addEventListener("offline", (event) => {
      console.log("The network connection has been lost.");
  });

  window.addEventListener("online", (event) => {
      console.log("You are now connected to the network.");
  });
#+end_src

- ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/online_evetn

*** Optional chaining
- This is super helpful (If you are using latest javascript).
#+begin_src javascript
  object = null;
  object?.property // Undefined - no error will be thrown
#+end_src
- If the object is null, then we get undefined value not error thrown at runtime which is super cool


That's it. Thats all the things i learned during this week.
