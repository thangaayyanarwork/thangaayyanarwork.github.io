#+begin_src clojure
  (def a (atom {}))

  (add-watch a :watcher
             (fn [key atom old-state new-state]
               (prn "-- Atom Changed --")
               (prn "key" key)
               (prn "atom" atom)
               (prn "old-state" old-state)
               (prn "new-state" new-state)))

  (reset! a {:foo "bar"})

  ;; "-- Atom Changed --"
  ;; "key" :watcher
  ;; "atom" #<Atom@4b020acf: {:foo "bar"}>
  ;; "old-state" {}
  ;; "new-state" {:foo "bar"}
  ;; {:foo "bar"}

*** Emacs Copy, Cut (Kill), Paste (Yank) Trick
- Assume you want to copy or cut part of a paragraph, but not the entire thing.
- Go to the start of the text you want to select and press C-space twice.
- Then, move to the end of the text you want to operate on and press C-w to cut (kill) or M-w to copy.
- This method works in reverse as well, which is quite interesting.
- Normally, I select the text I want and then press the copy or cut command, but this approach changes the way you do it completely.

*** CSS before trick
- If you need to add any whitespace before text use the below logic
#+begin_src css
  h2 {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }

  h2.space::after {
    content: " ";
    white-space: pre;
  }
#+end_src
